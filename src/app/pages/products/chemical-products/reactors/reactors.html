                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>At Yash Engineering Company, we specialize in the design and fabrication of custom-made Reactors
                        — both GMP and Non-GMP models — crafted with precision, safety, and reliability.
                        Each reactor is engineered to meet the specific process requirements of our clients across
                        industries such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and process manufacturing.</p>
                    <p>Our fabrication process ensures superior surface finishing, ranging from Matt to Mirror polish,
                        meeting the highest standards of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). With a deep understanding
                        of process engineering and quality requirements, we design reactors that not only meet today's
                        industrial challenges but are also built to perform for the future.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Reactors We Manufacture</h3>
                    <h6>1. Jacketed Reaction Vessel</h6>
                    <p>The Jacketed Reaction Vessel is ideal where heating or cooling is required using steam, hot oil,
                        or chilled water.
                        The jacket height is typically up to the liquid level of the vessel and can be fabricated either
                        as a single-piece or multi-section jacket, depending on operational requirements.</p>
                    <p>For higher flow applications, a segmental jacket is preferred — especially when downstream vapors
                        are used as the heating medium. For simpler applications, a plain jacket provides effective and
                        economical heating.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, spiral baffling can be incorporated inside the jacket to enhance turbulence and
                        increase the heat transfer coefficient, improving overall thermal efficiency.</p>
                    <h6>Key Features:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ideal for controlled heating or cooling processes</li>
                        <li>High thermal efficiency with spiral baffle design</li>
                        <li>Available in single-piece or multi-section configuration</li>
                        <li>Designed for pressure, temperature, and corrosion resistance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <h6>2. Limpet Coil Reaction Vessel</h6>

                    <p>The Limpet Reaction Vessel is designed for processes that demand high heat transfer rates,
                        mechanical strength, and operational flexibility.
                        The limpet coil design ensures high velocity and turbulence of the heating or cooling medium,
                        improving heat exchange performance.
                        It also reinforces the vessel wall, providing additional structural rigidity — an essential
                        advantage for high-pressure and high-temperature operations.</p>

                    <p>To further optimize performance, the limpet coil can be divided into multiple zones, allowing for
                        independent temperature control and enhanced process flexibility.</p>

                    <h6>Key Features:</h6>

                    <ul>
                        <li>High heat transfer efficiency with turbulent flow</li>

                        <li>Excellent strength and rigidity for high-pressure applications</li>

                        <li>Multiple zone limpet design for temperature flexibility</li>

                        <li>Suitable for both heating and cooling operations</li>
                    </ul>
