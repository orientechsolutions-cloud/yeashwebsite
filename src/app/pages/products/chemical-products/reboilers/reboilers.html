                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        At Yash Engineering Company, we specialize in the design and manufacturing of high-efficiency
                        Kettle
                        Type Reboilers used across a wide range of chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and refining
                        industries.
                        Renowned for their simplicity, reliability, and stable operation, Kettle Reboilers play a
                        critical
                        role in providing the necessary vaporization duty to the bottom section of a distillation
                        column.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our reboilers are engineered to ensure optimal heat transfer, operational safety, and long
                        service
                        life, making them a preferred choice for continuous industrial separation and purification
                        processes.

                    <h3>Kettle Type Reboilers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kettle Reboilers are widely used due to their robust design, ease of maintenance, and consistent
                        thermal performance. They operate by circulating the bottom liquid (commonly known as the column
                        bottoms) through the reboiler, where it is partially vaporized and returned to the column.
                    </p>
                    <h6>How It Works</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Steam or heating medium flows through the tube bundle, entering as vapor and exiting as
                            condensate.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The column bottom liquid flows through the shell side, where it receives heat from the tube
                            bundle.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A retaining wall or overflow weir ensures that the tube bundle remains fully submerged,
                            improving heat transfer efficiency.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The partially vaporized liquid returns to the distillation column, while the unvaporized liquid
                            (bottoms product) is withdrawn from the shell section.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the column does not provide sufficient liquid head, a pump-assisted circulation system can be
                            incorporated.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This design effectively reduces the presence of low-boiling compounds in the bottoms product and
                        maintains stable operational performance.
