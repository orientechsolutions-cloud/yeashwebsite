                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        At Yash Engineering Company, we specialize in the design and fabrication of high-performance
                        Shell & Tube Heat Exchangers engineered to meet the rigorous demands of chemical,
                        pharmaceutical, petrochemical, HVAC, food processing, and industrial manufacturing applications.
                        Our heat exchangers are trusted for their efficiency, durability, and precise thermal
                        performance, making them suitable for the heating, cooling, and condensing of process fluids and
                        gases across a wide range of operating conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We manufacture both Fixed Tube Sheet and U-Tube Type Heat Exchangers, each tailored to suit
                        specific thermal, pressure, and process requirements. With decades of expertise in custom
                        fabrication, we deliver heat exchangers that ensure maximum heat transfer efficiency, long
                        service life, and compliance with industry standards such as ASME, TEMA, and IS codes.

                    <h3>Types of Heat Exchangers We Manufacture</h3>
                    <h6>1. Fixed Tube Sheet Heat Exchangers</h6>
                    <p>
                        The Fixed Tube Sheet configuration is ideal when there is no requirement for tube bundle removal
                        and
                        the service fluids are non-corrosive or easily cleanable on the shell side.
                        These heat exchangers provide:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            High mechanical strength
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Excellent thermal conductivity
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cost-effective design
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Robust construction for high-pressure duties
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        They are preferred for applications where the process fluid is clean, or the heat exchanger
                        operates
                        in closed-loop systems.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h6>
                        2. U-Tube Heat Exchanger
                    </h6>
                    <p>
                        The U-Tube Type Heat Exchanger is designed for applications where thermal expansion differential
                        between shell and tubes is significant.
                        The U-shaped tube bundle allows for natural expansion, making these units ideal for:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Handling high-temperature fluids
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Services with large thermal variations
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Situations where tube bundle cleanability is needed on the shell side
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The U-tube configuration also enables cost savings due to simpler construction and fewer weld
                        joints.
